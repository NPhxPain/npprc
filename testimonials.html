                <p>I have been one of the top competitive powerlifters for several years.  My injuries seemed like something I would never overcome especially without surgery.  My experience with the clinic has been so positive.  They are very gracious and humble while providing relief that I did not believe existed.</p>

                <p>Working at school wasn’t very easy with my neck and back injury until I found Dr. Pierce and his staff.  From day one they all showed professionalism but most of all they showed a true concern and compassion for their patients.  Dr. Pierce tries to improve every aspect of our lives.  I can certainly say that I feel healthier, happier, and self-confident enjoying my renewed life without pain.</p>

                <p>I first heard about Dr. Pierce after I injured myself lifting weights. A friend told me how he used to have back problems until Dr. Pierce helped him in such a short time. Every time I have come in I feel like I’m getting top notch service, everyone is always happy and wanting to help. I won’t go anywhere else now.</p>

                <p>I came in having moderate pain all along my spine. Now after 3 weeks of therapy it has helped maybe 30 – 40 % of the pain disappear. By the end of my treatment I hope to be 90 – 100 % cured of my back problems!</p>

                <p>I was skeptical about Chiropractic Therapy. Dr. Pierce and his staff are very king, professional, and knowledgeable. I feel much better my pain has been eased (from car accident) and my quality of life has been improved.</p>

                <p>From day one there has been a considerable notice in my back issues. Though I am continuing my therapy, my lower back (in my opinion) is close to being healed. I still have some random strains and pains but with North Phoenix Pain Relief Centers expertise, I am confidant my recovery to 100% is in the near future! P.S. the staff and Dr are AMAZING!!!!</p>

                <p>For the past several years, my life has been controlled by degenerative disk disease and osteoarthritis. Most days, even walking was painful. I tried several rounds of nerve blocks and nerve ablations. Nothing worked for very long and I was finally reduced to taking heavy-duty pain pills to get through my everyday life. I was just sure that I would be unable to function at all in the very near future. At that point, I started being treated by the North Phoenix Pain Relief Center and began their program of pain management. At this time, I’m almost completely pain-free and my life has become my own again, not ruled by pain. It’s such a relief and a blessing.</p>

              <li>
                <p>I came to the North Phoenix Pain Relief Center for problems with almost constant headaches as well as neck and back pain. Besides my in office treatment plan I was also given several tools to use at home. Allergy testing found unexpected food intolerance which I’ve removed from my diet. Within a few days I was feeling better and after a few months my daily headaches were gone. Headaches only occur 2 or 4 times a month now and my back and neck feel much. Dr. Pierce and all the staff are friendly and great at what they do.</p>

                <p>I have been a patient for 2 years I and I have seen a tremendous amount of relief in my lower back due to the trigger pain, adjustments, and injections. I am able to do my fitness program with no side effects!</p>

                <p>Walking without pain was the best results from the injections. Pain which use to radiate down the front of my legs really caused much distress during my busy work days. This is no longer the case. I was afraid I would not keep up with my job as a maintenance worker. I no longer have to think about making such a drastic change especially at 58 years old. YEAH!</p>
